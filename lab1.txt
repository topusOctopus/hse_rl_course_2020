Solution for naive.py & initial_naive.py
Task: To find an issue

Describtion:
In file "initial_naive.py" 'generate_session' function we always choose action using argmax which is incorrect. 
In normal version of this algorithm "naive.py" we use np.random.choise which is correct, because here we are getting
an actions according to probabilities which was predicted by the agent. We can say we need pick them stochastically.
One more difference between 2 scripts is in "choose_elite function" in correct one it was decided to concat states and actions.
